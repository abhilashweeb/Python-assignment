What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","\n","*   Python is a programming language that is easy to understand and write, making it a popular choice among developers and programmers.\n","*   It is popular because it is widely used in industry, the data industry, a lot of libraries, used for both frontend and backend development for automation\n","to interact with data bases.\n","\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","*   An interpreter in Python is a programme that executes Python code line by  line.\n","\n","\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","\n","*   Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).\n","*   Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","*   No, we can't use keywords name for defining variable names.\n","\n","\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","\n","*   Objects/conntainers whose state or value can be changed after they are created are called muable objects. This is the conncept of mutability in Pyhton. Pyhton implements mutability with lists and dictionaries.\n","\n","\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","\n","*   Lists are mutable in Python because in lists we can add, remove or change elements.\n","*   Once we create a tuple we can't change or modify the elements, that's why tuple are immutable.\n","\n","\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","*   The \"==\" operator checks if the values of two variables are equal, while the \"is\" operator checks if  they refer to the same memory location.\n","\n","\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","*   Logical operators in Python are used to coombine conditionals statements or boolean expressions.\n","*   and & or are logical operators in Python.\n","\n","\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","*   Type castinng in Python refrs to converting one data type into another data type.  \n","\n","\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","*   Implicit Type Casting: Python is automatically converts one data type to another when needed.\n","*   Explicit Type Casting: The programmer explicity converts a data type using built in functions like int(), float(), str() and list() etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n","*   The purpose of conditional statements is to help us for making decessions based on some preconditions.\n","\n","\n","\n","12.  How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","*   The elif statement in Pyhton is used to check multiple conditions in sequence.  \n","*   If the condition in the \"if\" statement is False, Python will check the conditions in any elif statements in the order they appear. Once it finds a condition that evaluates to True, the corresponding block of code is executed.\n","\n","\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","*   For loop:It is used when the number of iterations is known. It iterates over a sequence(like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n","*   While loop:Used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition that is evaluated before each iteration. It keeps executing as long as the specified condition is True.\n","\n","\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","*   A while loop is more suitable when we don't know the exact number or iterations, but we want to repeat a task until a specific condition is satisfied. We can use loops for iterating over a sequence of elements.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_jVsEwEMFgiE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"AXAefQd6WsqX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"02GJ4bhBLMIh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
